## Overview
In this repository folder the electronics of the in-incubator perfusion system are described. The electronics are built around a Raspberry Pi 4, coupled with a Raspberry touch screen and a PoStep256 stepper controller. The electronic components with power supply and connectivity are assembled within a control box that is positioned outside of the incubator and allows direct control over the mechanical components via a 4-pin power cable. The graphical user interface (see [software](https://github.com/IRNAS/newharvest-incubator-perfusion/tree/main/software)) can in addition to the touch screen be accessed via wi-fi connection. Data logging takes place automatically once a USB storage drive is connected to the USB port.
