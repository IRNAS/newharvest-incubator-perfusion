## Overview
Here the mechanical part of the hardware components and their assembly are described. The mechanical unit of the in-incubator perfusion unit contains a peristaltic pump head, driven by a stepper motor, both mounted on a sample tray where up to 3 multi-well plates and medium reservoirs can be held in place. The tray also has attachable/detachable feet, that can be used to evelate the tray and fit a microscopy unit (e.g. Cytosmart Lux) under one of the samples. The individual design files of the components in the table below are assembled in the [design files](https://github.com/IRNAS/newharvest-incubator-perfusion/tree/main/hardware/design%20files) folder. The complete assembly file (image below) containing the mentioned files is available in the complementary [perfusion-system-assembly.STEP](https://github.com/IRNAS/newharvest-incubator-perfusion/blob/main/hardware/perfusion-system-assembly.STEP) file.

## Assembly and use
The [bill of materials and assembly instructions](https://github.com/IRNAS/newharvest-incubator-perfusion/blob/main/hardware/mechanics-assembly-instructions.pdf) for the mechanical part of the pump system are summarized in the complementary file. **Alternative design** - The described assembly uses a Nema 34 stepper motor to drive the pumping motion, however, we also developed and tested an alternative design that uses a spare DC motor used in Masterflex peristaltic pumps, described in the complementary [zip file](https://github.com/IRNAS/newharvest-incubator-perfusion/blob/main/hardware/NewHarvest_perfusion-system_alt.zip).
