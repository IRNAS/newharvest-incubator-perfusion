## Overview
Here the mechanical part of the hardware components and their assembly are described. The mechanical unit of the in-incubator perfusion unit contains a peristaltic pump head, driven by a stepper motor, both mounted on a sample tray where up to 3 multi-well plates and medium reservoirs can be held in place. The tray also has attachable/detachable feet, that can be used to evelate the tray and fit a microscopy unit (e.g. Cytosmart Lux) under one of the samples.
