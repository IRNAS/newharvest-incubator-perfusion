# Perfusion chamber
A perfusion chamber with integrated flow-manifold, allowing medium flow distribution and control over shear forces within respective scaffold compartments.

## File descriptions
- 00_main-chamber.stl (where the scaffold will be located during incubation)
- 01_channels-grad-A.stl (channel connectors on side A of the main chamber)
- 02_diffusor-A-grad.stl (flow manifold, distributing flow from tubing to channels on side A)
- 03_channels-grad-B.stl (channel connectors on side B of the main chamber)
- 04_diffusor-B-grad.stl (flow manifold, distributing flow from tubing to channels on side B)
- 05_top-cover.stl (chamber cover with gas and gas sensor input)
- 06_bottom-cover.stl (chamber cover with gas output)

## Required components list
- 00_main-chamber.stl
- 01_channels-grad-A.stl
- 02_diffusor-A-grad.stl
- 03_channels-grad-B.stl
- 04_diffusor-B-grad.stl
- 05_top-cover.stl
- 06_bottom-cover.stl
- 2x sealing filament, 0.5mm in diameter
- 6x M3 threaded bolt
- 6x M3 threaded nut
- silicone tubing 1.5mm in diameter

## Assembly and usage
the attached stl files can be manufactured by SLA/DLP resin printing. For biomedical research applications the used resin should be non-toxic. Cleaning and sterilisation of the filter should be performed according to resin specifications.

The 3D printed components are assembled as shown in the diagram below. The connections are fastened using M3 threaded nuts and bolts.
