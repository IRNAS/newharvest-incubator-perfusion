## Overview
This folder contains documentation of additional tools for liquid handling using the incubator perfusion system. Primarily, the system was adapted to use with P6 well plates (tested using [Falcon](https://ecatalog.corning.com/life-sciences/b2c/US/en/Cell-Culture/Cell-Culture-Vessels/Multiwell-Plates/Falcon%C2%AE-Plates/p/353046) and [Greiner](https://shop.gbo.com/en/row/products/bioscience/cell-culture-products/cellstar-cell-culture-multiwell-plates/657160.html), which are compatible with the 6-channel flow manifolds. Two design variations are available (see below). Furthermore, single-unit 

### Manifold variation 1

Design variation 1 can be used as an intermediary unit that fits between the well plate base and cover. The flow manifold can be manufactured using CNC machining from PEEK blocks, which makes it chemically stable and suitable for autoclave sterilization. The design was also sucessfully manufactured using DLP resin 3D printing. To connect the manifold to tubing, the input and output channels were modified with M5 threading and sucessfully tested using M5 connectors, that either extend to [tube fittings](https://www.nordsonmedical.com/Shop/Fluid-Management/Products/M6210-6005) or [luer-lock](https://www.droh.de/produkt/2835-luer-lock-adapter-mit-m5-gewinde-weiblich). Other options would also be possible, depending on which threading the channel is adapted to. To improve sealing, o-rings with 3x1mm dimensions (or similar) can be used.

### Manifold variation 2

Design variation 2 is not compatible with a multi well-plate cover. Instead the manifold can be covered with an [adhesive, breathable membrane](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/SI/en/product/sigma/z380059) to protect the samples while allowing sufficient gas exchange. Similarly to manifold variation 1, connecting the wells to perfusion can be done using threaded fittings, depending on the modification of the channels.
