# 15ml falcon tube cyclone filter
Cyclone filters function by particle separation from a fluid by centrifugal forces and gravity, which is beneficial for continuous filtration where filter components are difficult to exchange and potential clogging could reduce flow rates. This filter design is adapted for laboratory applications using peristaltic pumps and connects to 15ml falcon tubes that act as particle collectors.

## Required components list
- 15ml-falcon-hydrocyclone-filter.stl
- 1x o-ring seal, 14.5x1.5mm - to seal between the filter and the falcon tube at the tubing top
- 1x o-ring seal, 11x1.3mm - to displace liquid from the top part of the falcon tube
- 2x o-ring seal, 4x1mm - seal between the filer and tubing connectors
- 2x tubing connectors with M5 threading

## Assembly and usage
the attached stl files can be manufactured by SLA/DLP resin printing. For biomedical research applications the used resin should be non-toxic. Cleaning and sterilisation of the filter should be performed according to resin specifications.
The 3D printed filter components are assembled by placing the o-rings and using the filter to screw onto a 15ml falcon tube. Insert tubing connectors with M5 screws and seal them using o-rings.

## Performance testing
Here a sample performance test of the hydrocyclone filter is described and depicted in the figure below. It should be noted that filtration efficiency will depend on particle size and density compared to the liquid, perfusion rate and filter design specification (cone angle, filter orifice).

**Materials:**
- 2.5% (w/w) hydroxyapatite suspension in dH<sub>2</sub>O
- P6 well plate
- 15ml tube (Falcon)
- Assembled cyclone filter (link)
- flow manifold, connectors and tubing
- peristaltic pump

**Protocol:**
1. add 10ml of hydroxyapatite suspension to test and control wells
2. connect tubing and run perfusion cycle to fill the tubing
3. install the filter into falcon tube, filled with dH<sub>2</sub>O to the 12ml mark
4. connect filter assembly to tubing between pump and test-well
5. run continuous perfusion at 20ml/min for 2h
6. observe particle deposition into the falcon tube
